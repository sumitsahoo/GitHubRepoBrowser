This project demonstrates the usage of RxJava 2, Retrofit 2 and ObjectBox. Before starting with hands on I would suggest to go through the basics of RxJava and why we should use it. You can learn these from the links provided. With the help of RxJava the code behaves more like functional way and easy to understand. As the callbacks encapsulated inside Observable declarations the program flow remains intact and solves the callback hell issue we face in Android projects. Too much usage of callbacks results in GOTO like statements which breaks the flow of code execution. Rather we should focus more on optimizing the flow and making the code more readable.
